Python Projects
===============

> All of these projects are made using Python 3

This Github repository is full of little projects I made while experimenting with python.

Most of the projects in here are not of the best of programming quality; they are purely me experimenting with python and learning with it.

Each project will have a README.md file inside detailing how to run it. If not it is on my todo list!

Some projects may not be to the best of quality. They will say if they are inside there README.md, also check the list below.

| Runs and works correctly :white_check_mark:  | Runs :warning:                 | 
| ----------------------                       | -------------                  |
| [PingPong](PingPong/)                        |                                |
|                                              |                                |

Works being defined as good code, that I'm proud of!
Runs being defined as it actually running and not failing unexpectedly...
