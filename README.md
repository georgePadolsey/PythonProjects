Python Projects
===============


> All of these projects are made using Python 3

This github repository is full of little projects I made while experimenting with python.

Most of the projects in here are not of the best of programming quality; they are purely me experimenting with python and learning with it.

Each project will have a readme.md file inside detailing how to run it.

Some projects may not be run-worthy. They will say if they are inside there readme.md
