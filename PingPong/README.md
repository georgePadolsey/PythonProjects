Ping-Pong
=========

> This project can run and works!

This project is a basic ping pong game made with the base Tkinter module.

To run the project download the zip. Extract it and navigate to *PingPong/georgep/pokuit/ping_pong/*

Then go into the console at that directory and type:
`py PingPong.py`

If you get any errors it is most likely due to you having the wrong version of python installed.
